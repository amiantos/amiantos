### Hello there ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to my GitHub profile. You will find numerous things here for your enjoyment. But first, *internalize*:

> People have been thinking too long that art is a privilege of the museums & the rich. Art is not business! It does not belong to banks & fancy investors. Art is food. You can't eat it but it feeds you. Art has to be cheap & available to everybody. Art soothes pain! Art wakes up sleepers! Art fights against war & stupdity! Art sings halleluja! Art is for kitchens! Art is like good bread! Art is like green trees! Art is like white clouds in blue sky! [ART IS CHEAP!](https://breadandpuppetpress.org/products/why-cheap-art)
